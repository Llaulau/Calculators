# Calculators

The Swift code defines several functions that perform basic arithmetic operations, as well as a function performOperation that accepts a closure as a parameter and returns a string that includes the result of the operation.

The arithmetic operations are defined by the functions add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modulo, which all take two integer parameters and return an integer.

The performOperation function takes a closure that accepts two integers and returns an integer, along with two integer parameters, and returns a string that includes the result of applying the closure to the parameters.

The code then demonstrates how to use these functions by calling performOperation with different closures (e.g., add and multiply) and parameters, and printing the resulting strings. The code also includes several examples of closures that are defined using shorthand syntax, as well as an example of using the transformString and transform functions to transform a collection of strings. Finally, the code includes a commented-out section that generates a list of odd numbers.
